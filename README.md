# Data_Analysis_Bootcamp_Suzano
This repository contains all the projects realized during the Power BI data analysis bootcamp offered by Suzano at the DIO platform. If you scroll down you can see the descriptions for each one of the projects added to this repository.

### E-Commerce_Project
EER diagram for the operation of an e-commerce app and code in MySQL for that same project, based on the diagram.

### Oficina_Project
EER diagram for the operation of an automotive repair shop app and code in MySQL for that same project, based on the diagram.

Requirements:

    - System for controlling and managing the execution of work orders in an auto repair shop
    - Customers bring vehicles to the repair shop for repairs or periodic maintenance
    - Each vehicle is assigned to a team of mechanics who identify the services to be performed and fill out a work order (WO) with a delivery date 
    - Based on the WO, the cost of each service is calculated by consulting a reference table for labor
    - The cost of each part will also be included in the WO. The customer approves the execution of the services
    - The same team evaluates and performs the services
    - Mechanics have a code, name, address, and specialty
    - Each WO includes: number, issuance date, value, status, and a completion date for the work

### Financial_Sample_Project
Power BI report analysing sales and profit by country, product and segment, using the dataset attached to the project. The link to the report is available [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODk2YTk1ZWQtNjYzMC00ZGIwLTg2NjAtMDVmZTI0NTMwNTRiIiwidCI6ImZlODc4N2JjLWM5MTQtNDY2NS04NTQ3LTI2OGUxNWNiMGQ5YSJ9).

As a second project for the DIO bootcamp, I've created a more detailed report using Power BI for the Financial Sample Project. You can check the new report [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNGE5YzU0NjUtZWI0OS00ZDcxLTgyMWEtMjM2NDVjOWI3ZDQwIiwidCI6ImZlODc4N2JjLWM5MTQtNDY2NS04NTQ3LTI2OGUxNWNiMGQ5YSJ9).

As requested for the two final projects for the DIO bootcamp, I've recreated the report for the Financial_Sample_Project in two different ways using Power BI. To check the new final projects you can access the following links:

### Company_Project
After cleaning and transforming the data from the Company_Project database (a database created during the bootcamp), I've created a simple Power BI report for this project which you can see [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjMyY2IzMmMtMWYxNy00Njg2LTk2ZDUtNGU2MjJjYzBmZDI0IiwidCI6ImZlODc4N2JjLWM5MTQtNDY2NS04NTQ3LTI2OGUxNWNiMGQ5YSJ9).

### University_Project
The University_Project consists in a Star Schema diagram created from an university database EER diagram built by the DIO bootcamp instructor.

### DAX_Project
In this project I used Power Query and Power BI to create a Star Schema project based on the Financial_Sample table, also using DAX to create the Time table.
